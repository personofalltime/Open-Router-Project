# Open-Router-Project
A mostly 3D printed CNC Router + Firmware (for any arduino microcontroller) that I designed and developed myself!


# What is it?
- Cheap open-source CNC Router I designed
- Easy to use arduino firmware with a serial gcode interpreter (in theory, is compatible with most software for streaming gcode)
- Expanding support over time to make it compatible with more gcode commands!

# How expensive is it
- Quite cheap, especially compared to off-the-shelf solutions!

- Sub-£200!!
- Quite a lot cheaper given the ubiquity of most of these parts, and my overestimating of filament used (I used just over a kilogram for 3 full prototypes!)

# Motivation
I wanted to work on some larger projects at home, but soon realised that in order to be able to cut metal components to the fidelity I wanted, I would need some kind of CNC machine.
All of the existing packages I found were too expensive, and massive overkill for what I needed, so I set out to make my own system!
I made the firmware just because I wanted to though, there are plenty of other available software packages that you could set up with this system (I.E. using the Genmitsu GRBL control board would reduce a lot of the effort and cut the price down by over £20).

# Setup instructions
Follow assembly as shown in the full CAD model, available under the CAD folder. I've also provided pictures from every orthogonal direction, so it should be simple to assemble with those two resources combined. 

# Functionality
I haven't managed to test this yet, due to lead times on some parts, but I am expecting to be able to cut aluminium and possibly thin steel with this! MDF and Plywood should definitely be cuttable with this system.

# Conclusion
